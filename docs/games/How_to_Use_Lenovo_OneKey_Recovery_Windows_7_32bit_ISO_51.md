If you have a Lenovo laptop or desktop that came with Windows 7 pre-installed, you may have a hidden partition on your hard drive that contains a backup image of your system. This image can be used to restore your computer to its factory settings in case of a system failure or malware infection. This feature is called Lenovo OneKey Recovery and it can be accessed by pressing the **Novo** button on your keyboard or the **OneKey Recovery** button on some models.
